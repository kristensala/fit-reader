# Fit Reader TUI
Just a simple dashboard to filter through my workouts and show an overall summary and summary of road/mtb/indoor individually. Workouts are only implemented by importing .fit files which are generated after each workout by smart devices (Garmin, Wahoo, Mobile apps...). Manual workout editing or adding is not available.

## TODO
- Summaries are not calculated yet
- Last 7 weeks section is missing a bar chart which will be based on hours
- And what ever else I come up on the go...
